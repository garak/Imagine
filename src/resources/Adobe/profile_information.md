## Adobe ® ICC Profiles

Build quality color workflows with Adobe ICC profiles.

Adobe wants to enable consistent, high quality color workflows. For color workflows to succeed, color information must
be shared by many people, from original creator to final publisher. For this reason we are supplying our ICC profiles as a
free download for graphics professionals to use across their workflows.

Enclosed in our compressed archive are:

### Profile Installation

**To install the Adobe ICC Profiles on Mac OS X:**

You should install profiles in one of two locations.

Copy all of the ICC profiles to the /Users/<your login user name>/Library/ColorSync/Profiles folder. Profiles installed in this
location will be available only to the user who installed the profiles.

or

Copy all of the ICC profiles to the /Library/ColorSync/Profiles folder. Profiles installed in this location require the user to be
an administrator of the system. Profiles installed in this location will be available to all users.

**To install the Adobe ICC Profiles on Windows 2000/XP & Vista:**
Select the profiles in the “RGB Profiles” folder. While the profiles are selected, click and hold the right mouse button and
choose the “Install Profile” menu item. Use this same procedure for the profiles in the “CMYK Profiles” folder. Profiles will
be copied to the correct filesystem location and the Windows Registry will be updated. If the “Uninstall Profile” menu item
appears you already have an Adobe ICC profile of the same name installed.

### You may need to relaunch certain applications in order to access these profiles.


## Reference Information for Adobe ICC Color Profiles

## RGB Profiles

### Adobe RGB (1998) A color space with a larger gamut than sRGB IEC61966-

```
2.1 but smaller than ProPhoto RGB. Good choice for
print publication. Almost all colors available using
standard offset press printing conditions can be
encoded using this profile. Decodes color values to
viewing room colorimetry. The specification for Adobe
RGB (1998) can be found here: “http://www.adobe.com/
digitalimag/adobergb.html”. This is an output-referred,
version 2 ICC profile.
```
### Apple RGB Describes the color characteristics of the legacy Apple

```
Trinitron monitor, commonly used for press workflows
before the widespread adoption of color management.
This is an output-referred, version 2 ICC profile.
```
### ColorMatch RGB Describes the color characteristics of the Radius

```
Pressview monitor, commonly used for press workflows
before the widespread adoption of color management.
This is an output-referred, version 2 ICC profile.
```
### SMPTE-C Color space based on color standards in the US

```
television industry. Supersedes color definitions in the
NTSC 1953 ICC profile. The specification for SMPTE-C
can be found here: “http://www.smpte.org/smpte_
store/standards/”. This is an output-referred, version 2
ICC profile. SMPTE-C is the output-referred equivalent
of the SDTV NTSC profile mentioned below.
```
### PAL/SECAM Color space based on color standards in the European

```
television industry. The specification for PAL/SECAM
can be found here: “http://www.ebu.ch/CMSimages/
en/tec_doc_t3213_tcm6-10508.pdf”. This is an output-
referred, version 2 ICC profile. PAL/SECAM is the output-
referred equivalent of the SDTV PAL profile mentioned
below.
```
### HDTV (Rec. 709) Color space for high-definition video cameras. The

```
specification for the ITU-R Recommendation 709 can
be downloaded here: “http://www.itu.int/rec/R-REC-
BT.709-5-200204-I/en”. This is a camera-referred, version
4 ICC profile.
```
### SDTV NTSC Color space for NTSC video cameras. Uses the same

```
tone response curve as that defined for HDTV (Rec.
709) specified in ITU-R Recommendation 709. This is a
camera-referred, version 4 ICC profile.
```
### SDTV PAL Color space for PAL video cameras. Uses the same

```
tone response curve as that defined for HDTV (Rec.
709) specified in ITU-R Recommendation 709. This is a
camera-referred, version 4 ICC profile.
